# Where it came from

Hello friends! This project was created from a Glitch template that includes React, webpack, and Babel. The rest was created by me, [@clottman](https://github.com/clottman).

## Getting Off the Ground

The root of the project is in `client/index.js`. All it does is render the main React component, found in app.js. 

Data can be found in data/fish.js. Data was sourced from https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fish and re-formatted by hand.
